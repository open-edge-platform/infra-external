## Get Started

Instructions on how to install and set up the LOC-A Templates Manager on your development machine.

### Dependencies

Firstly, please verify that all dependencies have been installed.

```bash
# Return errors if any dependency is missing
make dependency-check
```

This code requires the following tools to be installed on your development machine:

- [Go\* programming language](https://go.dev) - check [$GOVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) - check [$GOLINTVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- [go-junit-report](https://github.com/jstemmer/go-junit-report) - check [$GOJUNITREPORTVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- [gocover-cobertura](github.com/boumenot/gocover-cobertura) - check [$GOCOBERTURAVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)

You can install Go dependencies by running `make go-dependency`.

```bash
# Build go binary
make build
```

The binary is installed in the [$OUT_DIR](../common.mk) folder.
