## Overview

This sub-repository contains the LenovoÂ® Open Cloud Automation (LOC-A) Onboarding Manager implementation for Edge
Infrastructure Manager. It ensures the syncronization of Host and Instances between LOC-A and the Edge Infrastructure
Manager.

## Features

- Import Hosts and Instances from LOC-A Inventory into Edge Infrastructure Manager
- Offboard Hosts and Instances by translating User intents into command executed on LOC-A
- Flexible deployments that span from a standalone binary to container-based orchestrations

## Get Started

Instructions on how to install and set up the LOC-A Onboarding Manager on your development machine.

### Dependencies

Firstly, please verify that all dependencies have been installed.

```bash
# Return errors if any dependency is missing
make dependency-check
```

This code requires the following tools to be installed on your development machine:

- [Go\* programming language](https://go.dev) - check [$GOVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) - check [$GOLINTVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- [go-junit-report](https://github.com/jstemmer/go-junit-report) - check [$GOJUNITREPORTVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- [gocover-cobertura](github.com/boumenot/gocover-cobertura) - check [$GOCOBERTURAVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)
- [swagger](github.com/go-swagger) - check [$GOCOBERTURAVERSION_REQ](../version.mk)

You can install Go dependencies by running `make go-dependency`.

### Build the Binary

Build the project as follows:

```bash
# Build go binary
make build
```

The binary is installed in the [$OUT_DIR](../common.mk) folder.

### Usage

> NOTE: This guide shows how to deploy LOC-A Onboarding Manager for local development or testing. For production
deployments use the [Edge Infrastructure Manager charts][inframanager-charts].

```bash
make run

# Or
make go-run
```

See the [documentation][user-guide-url] if you want to learn more about using Edge Orchestrator.

## Contribute

To learn how to contribute to the project, see the [contributor's guide][contributors-guide-url]. The project will
accept contributions through Pull-Requests (PRs). PRs must be built successfully by the CI pipeline, pass linters
verifications and the unit tests.

There are several convenience make targets to support developer activities, you can use `help` to see a list of makefile
targets. The following is a list of makefile targets that support developer activities:

- `lint` to run a list of linting targets
- `test` to run the LOC-A Onboarding Manager unit test
- `go-tidy` to update the Go dependencies and regenerate the `go.sum` file
- `build` to build the project and generate executable files
- `docker-build` to build the LOC-A Onboarding Manager Docker container

See the [docs](docs) for advanced development topics:
